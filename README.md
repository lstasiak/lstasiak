- 👋 Hi, I’m @lstasiak (Łukasz Stasiak, best tip for reading "Łukasz" correctly: 'woo-cash')
- 👀 I’m interested in many fields related to math, physics, programming and medical technology. To be more specific: I'm quite good in Python programming, Machine-Learning related problems and Big Data algorithms. Life is too short to be interest in one discipline, when the world waits to be explored and offers something more.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my ML/Big Data and Django framework skills and working as Junior Python Developer in @Sherpany. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some interesting scientific and AI related projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me: lukasz.stasiak95@gmail.com
