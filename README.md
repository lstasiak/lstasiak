- 👋 Hi, I’m Łukasz (best tip for reading my name correctly: 'woo-cash' or just call me Lukas 😃)
- 👀 I’m interested in many fields related to big data algorithms, deep learning, statistical physics, programming and medical technology. To be more specific: I'm quite good in Python programming, ML-related problems and Big Data algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my ML/Big Data and Django skills and looking for the new opportunities to check myself in the Machine Learning-related roles. 
- 📫 How to reach me: lukasz.stasiak95@gmail.com
